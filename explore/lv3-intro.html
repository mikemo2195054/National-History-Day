            As a result of being a gay person in the 1980s, you may have been at a higher risk of contracting HIV. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If left untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Research suggests that HIV may have originated from a type of chimpanzee in Central Africa, and may have jumped to humans as far back as the late 1800s. The virus slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world. In the United States, the virus has existed since at least the mid to late 1970s (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 'About HIV/AIDS').
