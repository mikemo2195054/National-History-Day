            Limiting number of sex partners is an effective way to prevent getting HIV, because the more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with poorly controlled HIV or to have a partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Both factors can increase the risk of HIV transmission.

            You should also choose less risky sexual behaviors. Receptive anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting HIV. Insertive anal sex (topping) is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex (bottoming). In general, there is little to no risk of getting or transmitting HIV from oral sex. Consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) when you are at risk of getting HIV or after a possible exposure to HIV.
