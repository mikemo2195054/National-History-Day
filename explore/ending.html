            Things have changed a lot since then, thanks to the efforts of LGBTQ activists and allies who fought for equality and recognition. Today, LGBTQ people have more options and opportunities to start their own families. Adoption, foster care, surrogacy, and assisted reproductive technology are some of the ways that LGBTQ people can become parents123. According to a survey by Family Equality, a nonprofit organization that advocates for LGBTQ families, nearly 80% of LGBTQ people aged 18 to 35 are already parents or are considering having children.

            However, there are still many challenges and barriers that LGBTQ parents face. Depending on where they live, they may encounter legal issues, discrimination, stigma, or lack of support35. That’s why it’s important to continue learning about LGBTQ history and celebrating diversity. You can be part of making history by supporting LGBTQ rights and families in your community. Thank you for playing this game!
