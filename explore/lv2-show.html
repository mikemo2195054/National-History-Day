            Unfortunately, in the 1980's cases of AIDS where increasing, people called this the “gay plague”. This was manipulated to blame and discriminate against gay individuals. Reporting in the press became more and more homophobic especially when the emergence of HIV and AIDS appeared. Most of the media demonized the LGBT community saying that it was God's punishment for homosexuals, and they got HIV or AIDS to "pay for their sins" The CDC initially referred to AIDS as "GRID, Gay Related Immune Deficiency Disorder".
