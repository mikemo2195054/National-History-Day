            According to (National Institutive of Health), you should use a condom every time you have sex to protect your safety. You should also read the package and check the expiration date, make sure there are no tears or defects, store condoms in a cool, dry place, use latex or polyurethane condoms and use water-based or silicone-based lubricant to prevent breakage.
