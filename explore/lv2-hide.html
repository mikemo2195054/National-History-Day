            You made the difficult decision to hide your homosexuality, knowing that it was the only option available to you. Unfortunately, the 1980s were a time when a wave of discrimination and stigma against the gay community was taking place. The rise of AIDS cases during this time only heightened the discrimination and bigotry against homosexuals.

            According to NBC News, "Reporting in the press became more and more homophobic, especially when the emergence of HIV and AIDS appeared. Most of the media demonized the LGBT community, saying that it was God's punishment for homosexuals, and they got HIV or AIDS to "pay for their sins." The CDC initially referred to AIDS as "GRID, Gay Related Immune Deficiency Disorder."
