            CDC recommends that all sexually active gay and bisexual men get tested for HIV at least once a year. Some sexually active gay and bisexual men (including those who have more than one partner or have had casual sex with people they do not know) may benefit from getting tested more often, for example, every 3 to 6 months.

            If you get HIV, you should take HIV medicines every day. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART cannot cure HIV infection, but it can reduce the amount of HIV in the body (called the viral load).
